Plants contain a large number of substances of a polyphenolic nature with the capacity to reduce inflammatory processes and, therefore, increase resistance to certain diseases. Examples of some polyphenols are the isothiocyanates found in cabbage and broccoli, epigallocatechin from green tea, capsaicin from chilies, chalones, rutin, and naringenin from apples, resveratrol from red wine and peanuts, and curcumin and curcuminoids from turmeric.

## Study Results

It has been suggested that curcuminoid supplementation could be interesting as a complement to pharmacological treatments, as well as as a prebiotic treatment in conditions in which there is no effective therapy, such as in the case of Crohn's disease, in patients admitted to Units Intensive Care for prolonged periods, and also in pathologies such as cancer, liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, obstructive digestive disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease

Compounds in turmeric, called curcuminoids (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin), give this spice great medicinal properties.

Its volatile oils, proteins, resins, and sugars also contribute to its healing power. Besides, to complete its 'queen of spices' profile, it also contains dietary fiber, vitamins C, E, and K, niacin, sodium, calcium, potassium, copper, magnesium, iron, and zinc.

### Benefits

#### Relieves upset stomach
Turmeric is a very effective natural remedy for an upset stomach. By having anti-inflammatory properties, it prevents heartburn and calms heartburn, as well as digestive disorders in general.

It is recommended for people with poor appetite, dyspepsia, gastritis, or slow digestion. The active principles of this spice favor the production of gastric and pancreatic juices, which in turn helps to balance the pH of these organs.

It is also recommended to avoid gases that are produced in the intestine. Being carminative, it prevents flatulence and intestinal colic and is recommended for stomach atony. It must be taken into account that the correct amount must be taken since its excessive consumption is counterproductive.

#### Diabetes

Turmeric (1 g/kg body weight) or curcumin (0.08 g/kg body weight) was in a recent study supplied daily for three weeks to rats with alloxan-induced diabetes and compared to controls. Significant improvements were observed in blood glucose. 

#### Neurodegenerative diseases

A growing body of evidence implicates free radical toxicity, radical-induced mutations, and oxidative enzyme impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). 

#### Ocular diseases

Cataract, an opacity of the eye lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Nutritional deficiencies, especially lack of consumption of enough antioxidants, diabetes, excessive sunlight, smoking, and other environmental factors are known to increase the risk of cataracts. However, the age-adjusted prevalence of cataract in India is, however, three times that of the United States, despite that have three different experimental studies reported significant preventive effects of curcumin against cataracts.

#### Respiratory diseases

It has positive effects in fibrotic diseases in kidneys, liver, intestine (Crohn's Disease), body cavities (prevention of fibrous adhesions) and on conditions with lung fibrosis, including cystic fibrosis. 

#### Treat liver disorders
Thanks to 'curcumin', turmeric is an excellent bile tonic. Even the rest of its hepatoprotective components serve as adjuvants to eliminate stones in the gallbladder and promote liver drainage. As it has anti-inflammatory properties, it is recommended for people with jaundice, liver cirrhosis, and gallbladder disorders.

#### Helps treat cancer
Surprisingly, the rhizome of this plant contains at least ten anticancer components, among which stand out, curcumin and beta-carotene. These elements have protective properties against various types of cancer, among which are colon, skin, breast cancer, and cancer of the duodenum.

In addition, it greatly helps the body to resist the effects of debilitating medications and strong treatments such as chemotherapy.

#### Powerful anti-inflammatory
The curcuminoids in turmeric give it great anti-inflammatory properties, becoming almost as effective as some anti-inflammatory drugs, but without the side effects them.

For this reason, it is recommended for disorders in which there is inflammation, such as menstrual disorders, Crohn's disease, bowel diseases, irritable bowel, colitis, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, obesity, etc.

#### Against cardiovascular diseases
Another benefit of the components of turmeric is its cardioprotective properties, therefore, consuming it frequently treats and prevents the risk of heart disease.

But this is not all, it also helps to reduce bad cholesterol and triglycerides. They recommend that, in addition to having a healthy diet, low in fat and natural, food should be seasoned with turmeric to naturally prevent cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks.

#### Works as a natural antidepressant
For thousands of years, traditional Chinese medicine has used turmeric to treat depression, sadness, and unhappiness. Turmeric extract, or what is the same, turmeric powder, stimulates the nervous system, activates the immune system, and awakens the mood.

It is ideal for reducing stress levels, as it produces an increase in serotonin. For this reason, it is widely used in people with seasonal or emotional depression, as well as other related disorders.

## Conclusion

To use medicinal plants and their active components is becoming an increasingly attractive approach for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders among patients unresponsive or unwilling to take standard medicines. Food derivates have the advantage of being relatively non-toxic. Within them, curcuminoids, such as curcumin, are chemopreventive agents from turmeric curry foods. Its bioavailability on oral supplementation is low but also its toxicity. Several studies have demonstrated several beneficial properties on inflammatory chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, gastric, hepatic, pancreatic, intestinal neurodegenerative, ocular, and respiratory diseases as well as on tobacco smoke-induced injuries.
