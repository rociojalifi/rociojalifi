description: Starting with the basic principles of human nutrition.

To start with this blog, it seems to me important to make a difference between what it’s to eat and to be nourished. For that I would like to look for the definition of both and then begin to expand each subject.

> “Eating” is the voluntary process of people in which they choose substances to introduce into their bodies. These substances can be broken, cooked, and continue with the digestion process"

As human beings we can eat almost anything. From mammary secretions (at birth) to mineral crystals (common salt), through fruits, flowers, seeds, stems, leaves, roots, algae, fungi, fish or bird eggs, and dead bodies of animals. All these more or less processed products give thousands of different foods that are sold commercially.

The fact that we can eat all this variety of foods, does it mean that they are all equally fit for human consumption? Is there perhaps an ideal diet for humans that, in addition to nourishing, preserves health and prevents disease?

Now let's see what the dictionary says about nourishing or nurturing:

> “It is the intake of food in relation to the dietary needs of the body. Good nutrition (a sufficient and balanced diet combined with regular physical exercise) is a fundamental element of good health. Poor nutrition can reduce immunity, increase vulnerability to disease, disrupt physical and mental development, and reduce productivity.”

In order to nourish ourselves we have to feed ourselves. But then how do we know that what we are eating is good for us and is keeping us healthy? Before continuing, I’d like to add another important definition after Nutrition. "Nutrient", what is a nutrient?:

> "They are chemical compounds contained in food that are absorbed and used to maintain health. Some nutrients are essential because the body cannot produce them and therefore they must be obtained from the diet. Among the essential nutrients, there are vitamins, mineral elements, amino acids, fats and a certain amount of carbohydrates as energy sources. Non-essential nutrients are those that the body can synthesize from other compounds, although they can also be obtained from the diet. Nutrients are generally divided into macronutrients and micronutrients. "

#### Macronutrients.

- Carbohydrates
- Proteins
- Fats

#### Micronutrients

- Calcium
- Iron
- Zinc
- Potassium
- Magnesium
- Phosphorus
- Sodium
- Copper
- Iodine
- Fluoride Later we will study each of them in detail.

Now that we know these three basic concepts we are going to apply them in a simpler way. We know that "feeding" are the activities through which we take food and introduce it into the body, which is a conscious and voluntary process. "Nutrition" is the set of transformations that food undergoes within the body and how it uses it itself. And that nutrients are substances that perform specific functions in our body. A food is made up of one or more nutrients. For example, rice, its fundamental nutrients are: carbohydrates, proteins, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, selenium and zinc.

#### What is the importance of a good nutrition?

The proper functioning of the body is fundamentally based on whether or not eating habits are adequate. For this reason, nutrition education and information campaigns have become the main lines of action for preventive health policy programs around the world. Basic knowledge about proper nutrition, according to your needs is essential to prevent numerous diseases and therefore to have a healthy life. To have a balanced nutrition it is necessary to take food from the six food groups, as indicated in the food pyramid, in an appropriate measure. We have clear examples of the consequences of poor nutrition, since as the World Health Organization points out to us, malnutrition is one of the most important causes considered as key factors of mortality in the world.

Next I am going to leave the nutritional pyramid (vegan). This pyramid must be adapted to the needs of each person, but in general terms it is the one that best suits the majority of the population. ![image](./image.jpg)

Food and nutrition are essentially variable processes depending on the type of organism and the environmental conditions that prevail in its habitat. Each group of animals presents a series of anatomical and physiological adaptations depending on their type of diet. For example, the robust trunk of the elephant, which feeds on vegetables, and the sharp tusks and claws of the lion, which feeds on meat, although both animals are mammals and share the same type of habitat.

There are also personal issues that determine variety in food intake when it comes to humans. It is necessary to highlight the geographical, climatic conditions, agriculture, the industrialization and distribution of food, the purchasing power of the population, regional habits and individual tastes.

Nutritional needs are different depending on height, weight, sex, age, climate, work, your level of activity and your state of health.

Nutrition is one of the factors that most safely and importantly conditions not only physical well-being, mental health, performance, productivity and the development of communities and their possibilities for improvement in the future.

Eating is an activity that everyone carries out and that, for everyone, it is usually one of the most important in their lives, but it is not always carried out in the best way, but with a little of effort, we can make a change that can have very good consequences for the rest of our lives.
