## Iron needs

While generalized recommendations offer some guidance, your specific iron needs are influenced by many factors, including age, sex, diet, and physical activity. 

Iron is considered a nutrient of concern for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Premenopausal vegetarian women and vegetarian athletes are also at risk of having low iron levels. 

Vegetarians can benefit from nutritional education on ways to improve iron status. In addition to the government-mandated iron fortification of staple foods, practiced in many developed and developing countries, in some countries food manufactures are allowed to practice voluntary food fortification programs.

The benefits of consuming vegetarian diets have been well established. Vegetarians have lower incidences of several health conditions including ischemic heart disease, total incidence of cancer, and type 2 diabetes. They also have lower body mass indexes compared to omnivores.

Despite the above-mentioned advantages, vegetarians also are at a high risk of a deficiency of some nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and iron. In vegetarians, vitamin B12 deficiency results from low intake of this nutrient, while the risk of iron deficiency is related to both inadequate iron intake and low bioavailability of iron from plant foods. The reason why non-heme iron is less bioavailable, compared to heme iron, is because of the naturally occurring absorption inhibitors, which mainly include phytate, oxalate, and polyphenols. Phytate is one of the most potent absorption inhibitors and is found in whole grains, legumes, and nuts. It has been estimated that more than 50% of phytate intake comes from grain products. This is significant because, for many vegetarians, grain products are also the most significant source of dietary iron. Thus, an extra eye should be taken into iron requirements for vegetarians.

## Iron absorption

The absorption of iron can be enhanced when a significant source of vitamin C and/or other organic acids is added to a meal.

That is why, grain products should be ingested with fresh fruits, such as strawberries, blueberries, and or citrus fruits. A similar if not better effect may be achieved if fresh fruit juices are regularly served with the breakfast meals. On the other hand, beverages such as tea, mate, and/or coffee should be limited. 

There are lots of factorst that affect the amount of iron that your body absorbs from your diet. The most important factor is that your body needs iron: more is absorbed when you are short of iron ans less is absorbed when your stores are full.

Iron absorption can be further improved by cooking, fermentation, and germination of foods. These food preparation techniques reduce the phytic acid content. Since grains are a major source of iron in many societies, appropriate use of these food preparation methods may have a significant impact on iron status. In addition, since tea, coffee, and mate are a major source of tannins, which inhibit iron absorption, the WHO suggested to limit drinking these beverages 1 to 2 hours after a meal instead of with a meal. Last, since calcium also inhibits iron absorption, the WHO recommended ingesting calcium-rich foods, at meals with the lowest iron content.


## Iron Vegetable Sources

Good plant sources of iron include lentils, chickpeas, beans, tofu, cashew nuts, chia seeds, ground linseed, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, kale, dried apricots and figs, raisins, quinoa and fortified breakfast cereal.

## Menu ideas

- Porridge with ground linseed and raisins, and 1 kiwi cut in dices
- Lentil curry with green vegetables. Previous to this meal you can drink a glass of water with lemon juice
- Stir-fry tofu with broccoli
- Stuffed red pepper with quinoa, vegetable meat, and onions


## Summary

- Eat everyday sources of iron and make sure you enhance it with foods with vitamin C
- Avoid drinking tea, mate, coffee, and/or alcohol during your meals
- Eat rich calcium foods with the meals that aren't the source of Iron
- Talk to your healthcare provider if you have concerns about your iron levels
- Talk to a nutritionist to change eating patterns if it is needed, or you aren't shure about how much you should eat and combine foods.
