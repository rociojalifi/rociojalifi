Building muscle mass is not something you do from one day to another. It takes time, the proper training, consistency, patience, and a good nutrition. With this article, I want to highlight the main points you need to consider when building muscle mass naturally and healthily. 

## How to build muscle mass?

### Intensity

The most important stimulus to muscle hypertrophy, which is growing muscle, is the intensity of the exercise. Maximizing the intensity in your workouts is one of the key points to grow muscle mass. And why that? Because what you want to do is to break muscle through difficulty. After the muscle is damaged it builds up stronger (with the proper nutrition). This can be done by following different types of sports and exercises. First, you need to set a goal: do you want to become stronger? Do you want to become fitter? After that, you can choose what kind of program you need to follow to reach your specific goal.

### Increase HGH (growth hormone)
HGH plays an important role in muscle hypertrophy, you need it to build muscle and prevent muscle loss. There are different ways of increasing this hormone. One way is by controlling the amount of insulin you have in your body. For that, it is important to watch out how many meals per day you have. I would recommend around 3 meals per day, no more than that. This does not apply if you are a professional athlete.

### Calories

You must calculate the number of calories you need per day according to your needs. The most common mistake I see in my clients is to overeat when they are trying to gain muscle. You indeed need to eat more calories, but unless you are a professional athlete it won't be a crazy amount as many people think.

### Carbohydrates
Don't overeat carbs. Carbs indeed stimulate HGH, however, if you eat more than what you need won't cause the same effect. 

### Proteins
Don't overeat and also do not eat less of what you need. Tons of protein in your meals won't increase muscle hypertrophy, it just creates more stress in your kidney and liver and it can actually increase your glucose. The recommendation is 1.8 to 2.2 gr per kilo per day.

### Sleep

Sufficient sleep is super important because if you aren't sleeping you increase stress and along with that you increase cortisol. Cortisol breaks down muscle protein so you definitely don't want it around you.

### Recovery
This is the key to muscle growth. Most of the people go to the next training session without being fully recovered and this may lead to injuries. When you workout, you increase the intensity to provoke damage, then you let it recover fully. The next time you work out, you will be a little bit stronger, and that means you actually grew muscle.

### Consistency and patience

This one is the last but still one of the most important. You won't see muscle growth after one week, maybe it will take one month until you see some progress. That does not mean that you won't see any benefits at all. Since you start exercising you will start feeling better physically and mentally. However, if you want to see progress over time, consistency and patience go together with all the points above.
