description: How important is food by itself to minimizing depresion, social anxiety and mental health.
---

Being sedentary, with obesity, and having a bad lifestyle can lead to depression, anxiety, and/ or any kind of other mental disorder. Changing your lifestyle may help you to cure depression or improve your mental health. Let's find out what recent scientific studies say about this topic.

## Etiology of depression

Today, the etiology of depression remains unknown but is widely believed to be multifactorial, stemming from a confluence of psychological, physiological, and environmental elements. Some of the specific causes of mental disorders are trauma, neurogenesis, circadian rhythms, genetic predisposition, pharmaceuticals, gut microbes, nutrition, and/or inflammation. Also, having a chronic medical condition increases a person's risk of developing depression. [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4]

In this article, I'm going to focus on explaining the three main causes that concern me as a Nutritionist, which are gut microbes, poor nutrition, and inflammation.

### Gut Microbes

The gut-brain axis, a pathway between the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system, is a critical component of mental health. In this pathway are tens of trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that comprise the intestinal microbiota. Stress, diet, and mood can work together or independently to influence the gut microbial population, ultimately promoting microbial imbalance, and a lack of microbial diversity.[^5] Dysbiosis, which is microbial imbalance, and low diversity contribute to altered immune function, deranged appetite and metabolism, and mood changes.[^6]

Gut microbes also influence dietary choices, which, in turn, an influence which microbes survive.[^7] [^8] Adherence to a Western diet, which is high in processed foods, refined sugar, and saturated fats, promotes a misfit population of microbes that chronically activates the body's immune system.[^9] [^10] This cycle of stress, poor dietary choices, and immune responses sets the stage for self-sustaining systemic inflammation and low mood.

### Poor Nutrition

According to some research, people with depression are often deficient in several important nutrients involved in modulating inflammation, neurogenesis, and aspects of metabolism, including folate, vitamins B6 and B12, and omega-3 fatty acids.[^11] [^12] [^13]

Depressed people often follow unhealthy dietary patterns, such as poor or excessive appetite, skipping meals, "emotional eating," or preferential consumption of sweet foods.[^14] Some of these behaviors are likely due to derangements in brain function. For example, whereas depression-related loss of appetite is associated with poor interoception (the ability to perceive sensations from inside the body, including hunger) depression-related increases in appetite are associated with hyperactivity in the brain's reward circuitry.[^15]

Studies have found low serum levels of zinc in people with depression. Zinc supplementation combined with the use of a multivitamin has also been shown to reduce anger and depression compared to the use of a multivitamin alone.

#### Food with zinc

Whole bread, oatmeal, pumpkin seeds, almonds, lentils, tofu, chickpeas, walnuts.

### Inflammation

Another important cause of depression is inflammation, a critical element of the body's immune system. Inflammatory responses increase depression, anxiety, and direct our mental health.

#### What is Inflammation?

Involves immune cells, cell-signaling proteins, and pro-inflammatory factors. While acute inflammation occurs after minor injuries or infections and is characterized by local redness, swelling, or fever, chronic inflammation occurs on the cellular level in response to internal and external stressors and is often “invisible.” Chronic inflammation is instrumental in the development of many diseases, including depression. Elevated biomarkers of inflammation, which are commonly observed in people who have depression, chronically activate the body's inflammatory response system, promoting the development of depressive symptoms and inducing changes in the brain and neuroendocrine function.[^16] [^17]

Food is extremely important when talking about inflammation, it is directly linked with obesity itself and this causes a general inflammation in the body. Especially when it is about combinations of food, such as saturated fats with high refined sugars (for example a glass of milk with your cookie). This combination can cause a postprandial (after eating) inflammation response and high postprandial glucose response. Can you imagine the cellular inflammation of a person who follows a high saturated fats and refined foods diet?

## What can you do to improve your mental health?

### Dietary modification

A diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats is associated with reduced depressive symptoms.[^18] [^19] [^20] Fruits and vegetables provide essential nutrients such as folate and B vitamins, most importantly, they deliver bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and others. These compounds reduce inflammation and protect cells from damage.[^21] Examining food groups in isolation showed that higher vegetable intake was related to lower depression, anxiety, and fear severity. Higher non-refined grain consumption was significantly related to lower depression and anxiety arousal severity and lower odds of having a current clinically diagnosed disorder compared to controls and these relationships persisted after adjustment for other food groups.

#### Omega-3

Omega-3 fatty acids have important anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties.[^22] It promotes the production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as resolvins and protectins.[^23]. Administration of high dose supplemental omega-3 fatty acids in conjunction with antidepressant therapies offer the greatest promise in treating the symptoms of depression.

##### Food with W-3

Seaweed and algae, chia seeds, hemp seeds, flaxseeds, walnuts, edamame beans, kidney beans, soybeans

#### Probiotics

Probiotics, which can be obtained in fermented foods and dietary supplements, are live microorganisms that impart health benefits when consumed. Findings suggest that probiotic intake may help reduce negative thoughts associated with a sad mood, reduced rumination, and aggressive thoughts.[^24]

### Physical activity

Exercise, particularly endurance or high-intensity aerobic exercise, may impact kynurenine metabolism in a way that is beneficial for creating resilience against stress-induced depression. Physically active people are less likely to develop depression.

Exercise and physical activity promote a wide range of neurogenic and neuroprotective responses that mediate depressive symptoms. It increases tryptophan transport into the brain to support serotonin synthesis; prevention the formation of neurotoxins associated with depression and increases anti-inflammatory factors [^25] [^26] [^27] [^28]

## Conclusion

The combined effect of the whole diet remains important for mental health. Being sedentary, being overweight, and following a poor nutrition diet may lead to depression and anxiety or not helping to fight it while following a treatment against any mental health. Changing the way you are living can do amazing things; do exercise, meditate in God, change the way you eat and what you eat. All of these things may help you to improve your mental health.

If you have anxiety, depression, any mental health condition, or just don't "going through the best time of your life" don’t doubt in calling your doctor or looking for advice from a psychologist. Mental health disorders are like any other physical disorder and it needs to be treated by a professional. No one likes to feel sad, without energy and lack or over emotions. The best you can do for you and the people around you is looking for professional help so they can help you out from your situation.
