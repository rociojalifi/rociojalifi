### What are the Carbohidrates?

> "Carbohydrates are macronutrients, meaning they are one of the three main ways the body obtains energy, or calories". They are called carbohydrates because, at the chemical level, they contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The recommended daily amount (RDA) depends of your body and your goals. But you have to know that the amount we need should be between 45% and 65% of the total calories.

### Function of Carbohydrates

So why we need them? Carbohydrates provide energy to our central nervous system and for the working muscles. They also prevent protein from being used as an energy source and enable fat metabolism. So watch out if you are following a low carb diet! Carbohydrates are important for brain function. They are an influence on mood, memory, etc., as well as a quick energy source. In fact, the amount of carbohydrates we need each day is based on the amount of carbs the brain needs to function.

#### Simple vs. complex Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are classified as simple or complex. The difference between the two is the chemical structure and how quickly the sugar is absorbed and digested. If you chose simple carbs, they are digested and absorbed more quickly and easily than complex carbs. Simple carbs are the ones found in candy, soda and syrups. These foods contain processed and refined sugars and don’t have vitamins, minerals or fiber. They are called "empty calories" and can lead to weight gain if you don’t control the amount we consume. Complex carbohydrates include beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, potatoes, corn, whole-grain breads and cereals. While all carbohydrates function as relatively quick energy sources, simple carbs cause bursts of energy much more quickly than complex carbs because of the quicker rate at which they are digested and absorbed. Simple carbs can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels and sugar highs, while complex carbs provide more sustained energy. So the best you can do is to focus on getting primarily complex carbs in your diet, including whole grains and vegetables.

#### How carbs work inside our bodies?

Carbs break down into smaller units called glucose and fructose. The small intestine absorbs these smaller units, which then enter the bloodstream and travel to the liver. The liver converts all of these sugars into glucose, which is carried through the bloodstream — accompanied by insulin — and converted into energy for basic body functioning and physical activity. If the glucose is not immediately needed for energy the body can store up to 2,000 calories of it in the liver and skeletal muscles in the form of glycogen! Once glycogen stores are full, carbs are stored as fat. If you have insufficient carbohydrate intake or stores, the body will consume protein for fuel. This is problematic because the body needs protein to build muscles. Using protein instead of carbohydrates for fuel also puts stress on the kidneys, leading to the passage of painful by products in the urine. We also have the famous fiber, which is essential to digestion. Fibers promote healthy bowel movements and decrease the risk of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease and diabetes. If you are on a diet, fibers are your friends and you should keep it close. They are not absorbed in the small intestine and are not converted to glucose. Instead, they pass into the large intestine relatively intact.

#### Good carbs vs. bad carbs

Carbohydrates are found in foods you know are good for you (vegetables) and the ones you know aren’t (ice-cream). This has led to the idea that some carbs are "good" and some are "bad." The ones considered good are complex carbs, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes. These are not only processed more slowly, but they also contain nutrients. How do we know if a carbohydrate is "good" or "bad"?

#### Friendly Carbs:

- Low or moderate in calories
- High in nutrients
- Devoid of refined sugars and refined grains
- High in naturally fiber
- Low in sodium
- Low in saturated fat
- Very low in cholesterol and trans fats

#### Enemy Carbs:

- High in calories
- Full of refined sugars, like corn syrup, white sugar.
- High in refined grains like white flour
- Low in many nutrients
- Low in fiber
- High in sodium
- Sometimes high in saturated fat
- Sometimes high in cholesterol and trans fats

### Carbohydrates benefits

###### Mental health

Carbohydrates are important to the mental health. People on a high-fat, low-carb diet for a year had more anxiety, depression and anger than people on a low-fat, high-carb diet. This is because carbohydrates help with the production of serotonin in the brain.

###### Weight Loss

Though carbs are often blamed for weight gain, the right kind of carbs can actually help you lose and maintain a healthy weight. This happens because many good carbohydrates, especially whole grains and vegetables with skin, contain fiber. It is difficult to get sufficient fiber on a low-carb diet. Dietary fiber helps you to feel full, and generally comes in relatively low-calorie foods.

###### Good source of nutrients

Whole, unprocessed fruits and vegetables are well known for their nutrient content. Some are even considered superfoods because of it — and all of these leafy greens, sweet potatoes, berries, citruses and apples contain carbs. Whole grains had significantly higher amounts of fiber, energy and polyunsaturated fats, as well as all micronutrients (except vitamin B12 and sodium).

###### Heart health

Fiber also helps to lower cholesterol. The digestive process requires bile acids, which are made with cholesterol. As your digestion improves, the liver pulls cholesterol from the blood to create more bile acid, reducing the amount of LDL, the "bad" cholesterol.

#### Carbohydrate deficiency

Not getting enough carbs can cause problems. Without sufficient fuel the body gets no energy. If the body has insufficient carbohydrate intake or stores, it will consume protein for fuel. This is problematic because the body needs protein to make muscles. People who don't consume enough carbohydrates may also suffer from insufficient fiber, which can cause digestive problems and constipation.
