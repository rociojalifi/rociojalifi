## About this workshop

There is strong evidence that the consumption of heavily processed foods, coupled with cultural shifts away from the preparation of food in the home, has contributed to poor and unhealthy lifestyles.

By the end you should have the tools you need to distinguish between a portion of food that will support your health and one that would threaten it.

Also, I will present a simple menu you can cook at home, which will help you to change step by step your lifestyle to live longer and a healthier life.
