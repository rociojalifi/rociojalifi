description: Vitamins and minerals supplements are the most commonly used self-medicated drugs. But do we really need them?
---

Some days ago I was at a friend's house and she asked: **"Hey do you want some vitamins? I have this, and this and that"** And I answered: **"Yes, cool! Let's nourish the body with these little ones!"**

Afterward, I started thinking: **Do I need to use vitamins and minerals supplements when I can provide those micronutrients with food?**

Vitamins, minerals, and food supplements (FSs) are often used without medical prescription. These are the most commonly used self-medicated OTC (over-the-counter) drugs. The highest commonly reported reason for self-medication is "prevention". 

## What are vitamins and mineral supplements?

Multivitamins and minerals supplements contain a combination of vitamins and minerals and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs, amino acids, and/or enzymes. Taking supplements comes from the fact that for some reason an individual can't or don't consume enough minerals or vitamins. They should not be the main source of micronutrients, just a way of complementing our diet in case we need it. 

The vitamins and minerals included perform unique functions in the body. We need them to live a healthy life and avoid physical and mental diseases.

## Which types can we find?

There are many types of multivitamin and mineral supplements on the market. The most common are daily staples that contain all or most of the vitamins and minerals, in amounts that are close to the recommended. They come in containers of one or two pills daily.

The recommended amounts of nutrients that individuals should consume are different from one person to another. Also, it varies according to age, sex, and activities the person performs. This is known as RDA, which means recommended daily amounts.

For supplements and diet food labels, a value is selected for each nutrient, known as the daily value (DV). The label indicates the % of Daily Value, allowing you to verify how much (in percentage) a portion of the product contributes to reaching the DV.


## Effects of supplements on health

**Increase nutrient intake**:consuming a multivitamin/mineral supplement increases nutrient intake and allows people to get the recommended amounts of vitamins and minerals when they can't, or don't cover, these needs only with food. However, consumption of a multivitamin/mineral supplement can also increase the chance of receiving an excessive amount of certain nutrients, such as iron, vitamin A, zinc, niacin,  folic acid, and calcium.

**Health promotion and prevention of chronic diseases**:It is more likely that those who have healthier diets and lifestyles take dietary supplements, making it difficult to identify the benefits of multivitamin/mineral supplements.

## Should I take supplements?

Multivitamin/mineral supplements must not replace the variety of foods. Food not only provides vitamins and minerals, they also contain fibers and other nutrients that have positive effects on health. But for individuals who don't get enough vitamins and minerals just from food, consume low-calorie diets, have little appetite, or do not eat certain foods, might consider a supplement multivitamin/mineral. 

Multivitamin/mineral supplements can also be recommended to patients with certain medical conditions such as.

- **Women of reproductive** age may lack folic acid which reduces the risk of birth defects in the brain and spinal column in the newborn.
- **Pregnant women** often experience lack of iron. The doctor may prescribe iron supplements because of deficiency.
- **Post-menopausal woman**: Calcium and vitamin D to strengthen bones. It should be provided with medical prescriptions.
- **People over 50** might not be able to absorb nutrients properly and could need calcium and vitamin D supplements.


### In what cases is it recommended?

According to dietary guidelines, individuals should get most of their nutrients from food. Food contains vitamins, minerals, dietary fibers, and other substances beneficial to health.

They are recommended when, despite following a balanced diet, there are deficiencies of one or more nutrients in the body. But these deficits must be correctly diagnosed with the relevant tests by a doctor or a specialist who will guide us in the treatment.

The most common causes of this lack of vitamins and/or minerals are the reduced consumption of these nutrients (unbalanced diets, lack of financial resources), intestinal losses (digestive diseases, surgical procedures), or poor use by the body.

Mineral and vitamins supplements, when there is no associated pathology, are unnecessary and represent extra money for individuals. They must be indicated and prescribed under medical supervision, always with a prescription. The ingestion of some supplements without medical supervision can lead to more or less serious side effects due to overdose depending on the dose supplied and the time of consumption.

## Final thoughts

A varied and balanced diet is enough to cover the daily nutritional requirements. If you follow a balanced eating pattern, you shouldn't be worried about nutritional supplements. Luckily for us, we can find fresh, seasonal, nutritionally rich, and tasty products everywhere, which are an excellent repository of vitamins and minerals.
