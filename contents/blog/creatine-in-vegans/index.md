Creatine monohydrate is a nutritional supplement often consumed by athletes in anaerobic sports. Creatine is naturally found in most meat products; therefore, vegetarians have reduced creatine stores and may benefit from supplementation.

## Study Results

Creatine supplementation in vegetarians increased total creatine, and phosphocreatine concentrations in muscle, plasma, and red blood cells, often to levels greater than omnivores. Creatine supplementation had no effect on brain levels of phosphocreatine. Creatine supplementation increased lean tissue mass, muscular strength, muscular endurance. Studies were mixed on whether creatine supplementation improved exercise performance in vegetarians to a greater extent compared to omnivores.

When done correctly, vegetarian diets offer the correct amount of healthy fats that will not only decrease immunosuppression but also increase immunocompetence. In this light, the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada state that vegetarian diets are a healthy alternative for athletes of all ages. On the other hand, a vegetarian diet could be lacking in certain macro-and micronutrients if they are not properly supplemented to dietary intake Creatine

Creatine is naturally found in animal tissues such as meats, fish, and poultry. As a result, there is decreased intake among vegetarian athletes. Dietary intake of creatine is significantly reduced in individuals following a vegetarian diet (egg and dairy products may contribute to providing very small amounts of creatine), while in vegan diets, almost no exogenous source of creatine is consumed.

## Purpose of Creatine

Approximately 1 g/day of creatine is synthesized by the body from arginine, glycine, and methionine.

Approximately 90% of the body’s creatine is stored in muscle as free creatine and phosphocreatine. During high-intensity exercise, phosphocreatine is broken down into creatine and a phosphate molecule. The phosphate molecule is then quickly paired with an ADP molecule to form ATP. This ATP is then used to power muscle contraction. The concentration of phosphocreatine decreases rapidly after the onset of activity, leading to fatigue. Starting an activity with a high store of phosphocreatine helps to enhance performance as well as recovery. As vegetarians do not consume animal products, they may receive strong performance and recovery benefits with creatine supplementation.

## Creatine Supplementation in Vegetarians

Since creatine and phosphocreatine concentrations may be lower in the muscle of vegetarians, there is a good potential that supplementation with creatine might improve creatine and phosphocreatine concentrations, and potentially enhance exercise performance and recovery in vegetarians. It should be noted that although creatine is found mostly in animal products, the creatine in most supplements is synthesized from sarcosine and cyanamide, does not contain any animal by-products, and is, therefore “vegan-friendly”

The only precaution is that vegans should avoid creatine supplements delivered in capsule form because the capsules are often derived from gelatin and therefore could contain animal by-products

## Creatine absorption

Creatine supplementation in vegetarians is effective for increasing creatine and phosphocreatine levels to an extent that vegetarians may achieve higher levels of creatine and phosphocreatine after supplementation, compared to omnivores (i.e., it appears that the lower baseline levels in vegetarians might allow for “super-compensation” of creatine or phosphocreatine levels with supplementation). This leads to speculation that omnivores might be able to deplete their muscles of creatine (through meat abstinence) to achieve a super-compensation of creatine and phosphocreatine levels with supplementation.

Since vegetarians respond better than omnivores to creatine supplementation, it might be expected that creatine would enhance exercise performance to a greater extent in vegetarians; however, studies are mixed

## Conclusion

Taken together, creatine supplementation has the ability to increase performance in vegetarians as well as omnivores; however, the research is not conclusive on whether vegetarians show a greater increase in performance than their omnivore peers. Most of the studies we reviewed were limited by moderate to high risks of bias; therefore, future studies of creatine supplementation in vegetarians could be improved by more vigorous randomized controlled trial designs.

There are a number of factors that may influence the effectiveness of creatine supplementation such as the amount of total stored creatine and how long the individual has been a vegetarian. Creatine supplementation could be useful, particularly in stricter vegetarians such as vegans, since their total creatine stores will be lower, and as a result, they will see the greatest increases in creatine stores with supplementation. Additionally, it would be useful in individuals who have been vegetarians for a while, longer than six weeks, as this is has been shown to be the washout time for creatine supplementation for vegetarians. Overall, creatine supplementation could be useful for any athletes who have low pre-existing muscle creatine stores, and this is typical in vegetarians. Further research is still necessary to see how creatine supplementation affects elite-level vegetarian athletes, and the different types of vegetarian
