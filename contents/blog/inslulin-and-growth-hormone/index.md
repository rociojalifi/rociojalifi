If you go to the gym or exercise regularly, chances are you heard that you need to have a pre-workout meal or protein shake as a post-workout to fill your glycogen reserve and help to build more muscle mass. Gotta get those gains, am I right? I lost count already of how many times I advised this to my clients and I did it myself. Looking for  different points of view, based on scientific studies, helped me gain more clear knowledge about this topic. Because, when it is about nutrition, there are so many exceptions, and each one of them should be treated differently in the healthiest possible way.

This article is aimed at those who are trying to lose body fat for health reasons and trying to gain a decent amount of muscle mass. The exceptions are professional athletes, those who work out more than once per day, professional bodybuilders, those that train for marathons or long-distance running, or people who suffer diabetes with a lot of fluctuations in blood sugar.

To start with this topic I would like to talk about what is a glycogen reserve. We all have certain levels of sugar stored in the muscles. Glycogen is that stored sugar. It can be stored in the liver as well.

## Myth #1: you need a meal before exercise 

Let me ask you a question. Why would you want to eat something sweet before and during a workout if the goal is to burn fat? We have to burn off the sugar before we get to the fat. That's how the body works. The first half-hour we burn the sugar, after that is fat-burning. So eating before a workout session doesn’t seem that smart, does it?

Another thing many people do is eat high concentrated protein, like whey protein, as a pre-workout supplement. The more concentrated the protein is the more it will trigger insulin production. An avocado, which has healthy fats, has much less response from insulin than a concentrated protein whey powder.

### What does insulin do?

Insulin stops the fat-burning process completely. So every time you're taking whey protein or having a snack (especially when they are low in fiber), you're actually raising insulin. So I ask again, why would you eat before exercising if your goal is to burn fat and increase growth hormone (GH)?

When your goal is to lose body fat or gain muscle mass, it is all about calories in and calories out. You can have 1,2,3,4,5,6 meals per day with the total amount of calories you need per day to reach your goal. Just keep in mind that every time you have a meal, the insulin production is activated. So If you want to keep the insulin low keep an eye on the number of meals you have every  day.

## Myth #2: you need to eat protein after your workout 

Muscle starts to rebuild around  24hs after exercise is finished. If you have this idea that taking a shake after your exercise is going to build muscle, I’m sorry to disappoint you but it is not. Digestion takes a long time so the proteins wont reach the muscles as quickly as you’d expect. In other words, you don't really need protein around your workouts to build muscle mass. What indeed is going to help to build muscle is the meal that you ate yesterday, not during or immediately after the workout.

Another thing to consider is, if your liver is overloaded with too much protein, those wont end up in your muscles either. Our bodies do really a really good job to build muscle when our liver is healthy and not overloaded. As a rule of thumb don’t go over 2.4 gr protein per kilo per day, more than that wont make a difference.

**The focus then is to avoid excess of insulin, because as we pointed out already, it nullifies the growth hormone production.**

When exercising you induce a stress event that breaks down your muscle and it burns up sugar in the muscles. Once you stop, your body will start to recover. The recovery process is where your digestion is occurring, where your body is building back up, where it uses fat. So if you eat during this process you are going to slow down the benefits of weight loss and muscle building. This doesn't mean that you should not eat anything for the whole day or evening after your physical activity. This means that you need to plan better the time of your meals so you don't go straight away to eat or snack after exercising. You are going to have even better results if you avoid this "post-workout meal/snack" and then eat a good meal at the proper time, especially when you aren't performing a physical activity as a professional athlete.

## Key points

1. The benefits of exercise actually occur 24 to 48 hours after when you are in a deep sleep. So part of a good strategy is getting good sleep.

1. You need to minimize the insulin production while you sleep and this will have an effect on maximizing growth hormone during sleep as well. There should be a gap of at least 3 hours or so between your last meal and your sleep.

1. If you are not in the exceptions that I mentioned at the beginning of the article, and only interested in average health benefits, my advice is to consume healthy carbs with fiber, healthy fats, and a moderate amount of protein for breakfast.

1. Plan intelligently your last meal of the day if you are going to exercise before breakfast.

1. Eat fiber! I cannot stress that one enough. They are in vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts, legumes, and whole grains.

1. Growth hormone production is triggered by exercise, sleep, and lower levels of insulin. Focus on improving these to maximize your goals!
