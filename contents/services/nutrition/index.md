## Introduction

Most of the time physical and mental complaints are consequences of poor nutrition habits. These complaints or symptoms can be reduced by making simple changes in the diet and lifestyle. However,
learning to maintain a healthy lifestyle needs coaching, guidance, and learning.

Each new client will have the possibility to acquire a very comprehensive nutrition plan, fully composed, and calculated on personal goals, lifestyle, and health complaints. At each appointment you are going to receive personal advice and food education, not standard nutrition schedules.

### New Client Plan

As a new client, you'll begin with three sessions designed to deep dive into your goals, health history, and lifestyle. You'll receive personalized nutrition plans with several other resources so you feel confident moving forward. After these three sessions, I can continue to support you with follow-up sessions, providing you with additional guidance as you develop new habits and navigate life's challenges.

#### Session #1 - Initial Consultation

This Initial Consultation is a 60-minute session where we discuss your vision of health, set goals, and lay the framework from which we’ll use for our entire coaching relationship.

We’ll do a deep dive into your questionnaire, food log, dietary assessment, past medical history, education individualized to your focus area, and wrap up with agreeing upon several foundational goals to get you on track and feeling great!

###### What’s included

- Coaching sessions are virtual
- Dietary assessment
- Lifestyle assessment
- Wellness vision and weekly goal setting to create a coaching roadmap
- Health objectives and “healthy homework assignments" to work on between our sessions
- Feedback on food diaries: per day, per week, or month via e-mail

#### Session 2 - Nutrition Plan

After you’ve completed the **Initial Consultation** and have put into action your foundational goals for at least one week, you’re ready for your second appointment which is all about the nutrition plan and education about eating patterns, how to nourish your body, and eat well for life.

In this 60-minute session, we’ll go over the nutrition plan created for you after learning all about your specific goals. We’ll cover how to assess hunger cues, mind-body connection, and how to perform daily check-ins — whatever is best to meet your individual needs.

###### What’s included:

- Specific education related to your goals
- Nutrition Plan
- Lifestyle Plan (at the discretion of the coach)
- Recipes of snacks, portion control, travel ideas, dining out, etc.
- Grocery shopping lists as needed
- Weekly goal setting
- Healthy homework assignments

#### Session 3 - Follow Up

After you’ve completed the second appointment, we'll have a follow-up session to see how things are working, what challenges you might be facing, and how to progress forward.

This follow up session will adjust depending on your needs.

It may include specific nutrition education topics you want to learn about, customized meal plans (i.e. updates to your nutrition plan), functional nutrition and health strategies, healthy cooking education, motivational techniques, and more.
