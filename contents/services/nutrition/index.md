### Introduction

Learning to maintain a healthy diet needs more explanation, coaching & guidance than just giving nutritional advice (including feedback on the food diary) and an example daily menu or diet plan. So many factors come into play. Therefore I use a holistic approach (holistic medicine involves the entire individual. The 'whole' looks at more factors than just nutrition).

Is also a possibility to have a very comprehensive nutrition plan drawn up, fully composed, and calculated on personal goals, lifestyle, and health complaints. You will always receive personal advice, no standard nutrition schedules.

#### Services

- Personal nutrition plans (including a complete intake form or without intake form): drawn up concisely a daily menu (for example intolerances, vegetarian/vegan plan, sports nutrition, weight loss, weight gain, etc.). This service includes an introduction and an intake process.
- Introduction: Max. 10-15 minutes (if the meeting has been made by appointment and within 24h before the call is canceled or there is no response, you will be charged €15).
- Intake: 40 - 60 minutes. This intake form provides personalized advice through information about your situation and what are your expectations.
