## Hi there,

I’m from Buenos Aires, Argentina but currently based in Amsterdam, The
Netherlands. I studied in the River Plate Adventist University and I got a
Bachelor degree in Nutrition. I've been most of my life into food stuff so since
I got my degree I've been working in the food indutry in different ways:
creating new products, recipes and giving nutritional education to the community
to prevent food diseases.

## My story

I’ve been vegetarian almost my whole life but nevertheless my nutrition wasn’t
the best. Because of poor nutrition habits I got a bad infection in different
parts of my body, so I decided that I needed a change in my lifestyle.

This disease woke up even more the desire to learn more about nutrition. I
wanted to continue eating tasty but without harming my body.

That's when I started my path into a better lifestyle. Through this way I made a
lot of mistakes until I learnt that living a healthy lifestyle is not just
eating good food, but also working on healthy choices to grow yourself socially,
mentally and spiritualy.

Only a holistic lifestyle can help you on reaching the best living.

That's because I want to open this space to create a community where we can help
eachother across this way of trying to get the best life.
