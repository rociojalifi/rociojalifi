## Hi there,

I’m from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Currently, I'm living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I studied at the River Plate Adventist University where I got a Bachelor's degree in Nutrition. Most of my life I've been into foodstuff. Since I got my degree I work in the food industry in different ways: creating new products, recipes, and providing nutritional education to the community to prevent lifestyle diseases.

### My story

I’ve been vegetarian almost my whole life but nevertheless, my nutrition wasn’t the best. Because of bad nutrition habits, I got an infection in different parts of my body, so I decided that I needed a change in my lifestyle.

This disease woke up, even more, the desire to learn more about nutrition. I wanted to continue eating tasty but without harming my body.

That's when I started a path into a better lifestyle. Through this process, I made a lot of mistakes until I learned that living a healthy lifestyle is not just eating good food, but also working on healthy choices to grow yourself socially, mentally and spiritually.

I believe that only a holistic lifestyle can help you in reaching the best living.
