## Hi there,

I'm Rocio Jalifi, nice to meet you! I’m from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Currently, living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. For most of my life, I've been into foodstuff. Since I graduated, I work in the food industry in different ways: creating new products, recipes, and providing nutritional education to the community to prevent lifestyle diseases.

### My story

I’ve been vegetarian almost my whole life. However, my nutrition wasn’t the best. As a consequence of bad nutrition and habits, I got an infection in different parts of my body, thus I decided that I needed a change in my lifestyle.

The disease inspired me to learn about nutrition. I wanted to continue eating tasty but without harming my body. I also wanted to teach others how to conceive a healthy lifestyle, and how to eat well. That is why I decided to study Nutrition at the Universidad Adventista del Plata. The year 2015 I completed my studies with a bachelor's degree in Nutrition. From then on, I decided to continue specializing in vegetarian and vegan eating patterns, and nutrition for athletes.

Through this path into a better lifestyle, I made a lot of mistakes that caused me to deal with eating disorders and depression. Until I learned that living a healthy lifestyle is not just eating good food, but also it has to do with working on healthy choices to grow yourself socially, mentally, and spiritually.

I want to support you in cultivating a healthier relationship with food and working to develop healthy eating patterns that you can keep FOR LIFE!

**Let's work together ♡**
